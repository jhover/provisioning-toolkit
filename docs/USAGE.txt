Execute with one or more TDL files. 
 
For each <filename>.tdl checks to see if there is a <filename>.files.yaml
If so, it runs embed-files against the yaml, creating <filename>.files.tdl 

It then runs merge-tdl agains each <filename>.tdl and <filename>.files.tdl to produce <filename>.withfiles.tdl

It then runs merge-tdls against all <filename>.withfiles.tdl in order, with later TDLs overriding earlier where
there are collisions. Latter TDLs override equivalent content in earlier TDLs. 

 Either specify 
   -c <configfile> -p <profilename>
  OR  
 tempdir fileroot workdir [target|provider] TDL1 TDL2 TDL3 ....
